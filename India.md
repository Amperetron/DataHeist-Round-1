# Detective Case File: Round 1

You’ve uncovered pieces of the hacker’s passkey scattered across the system.
Fragments lie within the **Python files** and the **data files**.

Instructions:
- Fix the buggy Python programs (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta).
- Extract any fragments that appear in the other files (Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel).
- Assemble all fragments in order:  
  `Bravo → Charlie → Delta → Echo → Foxtrot → Golf → Hotel`

That sequence will reveal the **final password**.
Do note that the password fragments seemed to be separated by "-" and could've looked like: 
A-B-C-D--F-G-H
Good luck, detective.
